## Features

- **Patient Management**: Add, update, and manage patient information.
- **Doctor Management**: Add and manage doctors, their specialties, and availability.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Schedule, view, and manage appointments between patients and doctors.
- **Database**: Uses a MySQL database to store patient, doctor, and appointment data.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for the application.
- **MySQL**: Relational database used to store data for patients, doctors, and appointments.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity for connecting the Java application to the MySQL database.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing the database.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or above
- **MySQL**: A running instance of MySQL Server.
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kartik7011/OnlineHealthcareManagementSystem.git
Database Setup:

Create a MySQL database called healthcare_db (if not already created).
Run the resources/database_script.sql script to create necessary tables and seed initial data.
Example to create the database:

sql
CREATE DATABASE healthcare_db;
Then execute the script:

sql

SOURCE path_to_script/database_script.sql;
Configure Database Connection:

Open src/com/healthcare/database/DatabaseConnection.java.
Update the DATABASE_URL, USER, and PASSWORD constants with your MySQL credentials.
Example:

java
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/healthcare_db";
private static final String USER = "root";
private static final String PASSWORD = "your_password";
Run the Application:

Navigate to the src/com/healthcare/Main.java file and run the main() method to start the application.
Example Usage
Once the application is running, it will initialize the database and print the following:


Welcome to the Online Healthcare Management System
Database initialized successfully!
You can then interact with the system by adding patients, doctors, and scheduling appointments via the application's user interface.
